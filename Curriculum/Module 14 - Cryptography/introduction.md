# Cryptography

In this module, we will explore the fascinating world of cryptography. Students will learn about different encryption techniques, hashing, digital signatures, and public key infrastructure (PKI). We will also discuss common cryptographic attacks and how to defend against them.

## Learning Objectives

- Explain the fundamental concepts of cryptography, including encryption, decryption, and hashing
- Analyze different encryption algorithms and their use cases
- Evaluate digital signatures and public key infrastructure (PKI)
- Identify and defend against common cryptographic attacks

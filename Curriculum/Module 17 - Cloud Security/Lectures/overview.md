## 1. Overview of Cloud Security

Cloud security encompasses policies, technologies, and procedures to protect data, applications, and infrastructure in cloud environments. As the digital shift continues, the significance of cloud security parallels this growth.

### **Cloud Security**:
Protection of online data, applications, and networks.

### Key Concepts:

- **Service Models**:
    - **IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)**: Virtual resources over the internet.
        - *Google Cloud's Compute Engine*: Provides virtual machines.
        - *Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)*: Scalable compute capacity.
        - *Microsoft Azure Virtual Machines*: On-demand scalable computing resources.

    - **PaaS (Platform as a Service)**: Platform for application management.
        - *Google Cloud's App Engine*: For app development.
        - *Heroku*: Cloud platform supporting multiple programming languages.
        - *Microsoft Azure App Service*: Quickly building, deploying, and scaling web apps.

    - **SaaS (Software as a Service)**: Online software delivery.
        - *Google Workspace*: Suite including Gmail, Drive, and more.
        - *Salesforce*: Customer relationship management solution.
        - *Dropbox*: Cloud-based file storage platform.

- **Deployment Models**:
    - **Public Cloud**: Resources owned by third-party providers.
        - *Google Cloud Platform (GCP)*: Comprehensive public cloud services.
        - *Amazon Web Services (AWS)*: Offers computing power, storage options, and networking capabilities.
        - *Microsoft Azure*: Solutions for cloud-based workloads.

    - **Private Cloud**: Resources for a single business/organization.
        - *VMware Cloud on AWS*: Integration of VMware's private cloud technology with AWS.
        - *Oracle Cloud at Customer*: Oracle's public cloud services in your data center.

    - **Hybrid Cloud**: Blend of public and private resources.
        - *AWS Outposts*: Run AWS infrastructure on-premises for a hybrid environment.
        - *Azure Arc*: Bring Azure services and management to any infrastructure.
        - *Google Anthos*: Modernize on-premises or in other public clouds using GCP technology.
